The included bash script (`grade.sh`) only works for Macs, but you should be able to download or point to JUnit from other operating systems. For Windows, be sure to change the `:` to `;`, and I had to type these commands separately, since my bash interpreter was not working with Java/JUnit for some odd reason.

Do NOT forget to download all three data files into this folder before running the grading script! That is, include the three CSV files: `flights-2015-q3`, `aggregates`, and `testfile`.

Then, simply copy the student's Java code into this folder and run the bash script.
