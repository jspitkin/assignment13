 * <p>This class represents a graph of flights and airports along with specific

 * to accomplish this and you are free to explore those.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Testing will be done with different criteria for the "best" path so be
 * sure to keep all information from the given file. Also, before implementing
 * this class (or any other) draw a diagram of how each class will work in
 * relation to the others. Creating such a diagram will help avoid headache and
 * confusion later.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Be aware also that you are free to add any member variables or methods
 * needed to completed the task at hand</p>
